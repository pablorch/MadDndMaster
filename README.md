# Mad Dnd Master

In a world where the fabric of reality teeters on the brink of collapse, a Dungeons & Dragons Master's descent into madness begins at the very first step: character creation. With grand ambitions of crafting a rich and vibrant world filled with wonders beyond imagination, the DM's journey takes an unexpected turn as madness grips their mind.

As the Dungeon Master's sanity slips away, a desperate decision is made. With trembling hands and a heart heavy with regret, the Dungeon Master's conjures forth a cataclysmic event to end it all: a relentless storm of meteorites hurtling towards the world below.

Now, as the skies ignite with celestial fury and the ground trembles beneath your feet, you must navigate the chaos and destruction wrought by the Dungeon Master's folly. Will you brave the meteorite mayhem and emerge victorious, or will you be consumed by the flames of madness?
